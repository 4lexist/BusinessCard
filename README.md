# Online BusinessCard for Benjamin Code

Small web page that is meant to be full screen at all time with no scroll (on desktop). 
Mobile design choice was to keep the full screen frame but allow scrollable content inside.

The page includes small animations : the header titles are scrolling from left to right and right to left 
(marquee style), and there is a small parallax on Benjamin's picture and the circles surrounding it.

This is pure JS and CSS, no frameworks or library has been used.
